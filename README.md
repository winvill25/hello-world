# hello-world

I have 35 years experience in Information Technology starting all the way back to my Univac computer days. I transitioned from mainframe through client-server in both MVS/OS and Sun Solaris environments to Windows 10 and Azure and Amazon Web Services cloud computing. After retirement in 2013, I wanted to re-invent myself as a Web and App Developer.
